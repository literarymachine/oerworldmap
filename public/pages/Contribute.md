# Contribute
There are many ways to contribute to the OER World Map project. Many of them are active and can be used right now, others are still under development and will be implemented within the next few months.

## Spread the news

The OER World Map will deliver data by, about and for the OER community. Help us to raise awareness by speaking to you friends on social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter as well as in real live. On Twitter please use the hashtag [#oerworldmap](https://twitter.com/hashtag/oerworldmap).

## Register and browse

You can register for our newsletter and get counted as an OER community member for your country.

## Contribute stories

We invite you to share your OER story with the community and tell others about your OER activities! These could be OER projects or initiatives, Open Educational Practices like someone generating OER or teaching with OER, the development of guidelines & institutional policies on OER, new insights and research on OER, as well as the development or use of helpful infrastructure tools for OER. Please include a title and a text no longer than 5000 characters that describes the who, what, when, where, why and how of the activity. A photo connected to the story would also be great. Please note that stories will be published under [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you have an OER story which you consider worth sharing, please send it to [in&#102;o&#64;oerw&#111;&#114;ldma&#112;&#46;org](mailto:in&#102;o&#64;oerw&#111;&#114;ldma&#112;&#46;org). We are looking forward to hearing from you soon! Read more about it [on our blog](https://oerworldmap.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/call-for-oer-stories/)!

## Become a country champion

We are looking for country champion (networks) who will help to map the OER world by country. Ideal country champions are well connected institutions or communities, which have an own interest in getting an overview of the OER movement in their country. Country champions will gather data and raise awareness of the project. If you or your institution are interested in becoming a Country Champion, please contact us directly by mail to [in&#102;o&#64;oerw&#111;&#114;ldma&#112;&#46;org](mailto:in&#102;o&#64;oerw&#111;&#114;ldma&#112;&#46;org). Additional information on what it means to become a country champion can be found [on our blog](https://oerworldmap.wordpress.com/2015/04/17/what-does-it-mean-to-become-a-country-champion/).

## Propose new features and report bugs

We are taking an agile development approach, so you can help us developing the features which are most important to the OER community by contributing use cases (or “user stories”). If you are registered on GitHub you can [directly open a new ticket](https://github.com/hbz/oerworldmap) for your use case or for reporting bugs there. Alternatively you can send us a mail to [in&#102;o&#64;oerw&#111;&#114;ldma&#112;&#46;org](mailto:in&#102;o&#64;oerw&#111;&#114;ldma&#112;&#46;org). By having a [look at all existing use cases](https://github.com/hbz/oerworldmap/labels/story) and commenting on them, you can give us valuable feedback.

## Contribute code and develop applications

The OER World Map is 100% open. It’s complete source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/hbz/oerworldmap). Developers can contribute to the code or even develop applications which interact with the OER World Map.

## Translate the web page

To become a true World Map, we are aiming at providing a multilingual web page in the future. If you are interested in translating the web page into your native language, please contact us by mail to [in&#102;o&#64;oerw&#111;&#114;ldma&#112;&#46;org](mailto:in&#102;o&#64;oerw&#111;&#114;ldma&#112;&#46;org).

## Upload OER data collections

The OER World Map provides a powerful API, which can be used to upload existing OER datasets into our platform. If you own data relevant to the OER ecosystem (e.g. about institutions, projects or services) please contact us.

## Reuse data

The OER World Map provides a powerful API, which can be used to generate and export the data without any delay. Other applications can implement the complete or filtered World Map data to enrich their own web presence. We will develop special functionality which will support the reuse of data by providing flexible and easy to integrate gadgets till the end of the year. If you are interested in reusing OER World Map data, please contact us by mail to [in&#102;o&#64;oerw&#111;&#114;ldma&#112;&#46;org](mailto:in&#102;o&#64;oerw&#111;&#114;ldma&#112;&#46;org).

## Collect data using templates (planned for Sept. 2015)

Registered users who are providing an OER service, running an OER project or simply are interested in collecting clean data can use the OER World Map input templates to directly input data into the platform. This service is under construction and will be available by the mid of september.

## Participate in OER World Map Edit-a-ton (planned for Oct./Nov. 2015)

You can participate in the “OER World Map Edit-a-ton”, which will be a community event planned for October/November this year. The Edit-a-ton will aim at completing and enriching the data basis of the OER World Map.
